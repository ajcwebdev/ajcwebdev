I'm a Lambda School student studying full stack web development and a contributor to RedwoodJS. I'm currently seeking GitHub sponsors to support my work on Open Source. What do I do?

:writing_hand: - Write blog articles  
:speech_balloon: - Give meetup talks  
:studio_microphone: - Speak on podcasts  

Sponsorship would help me spend more time communicating about open source projects. Here are some examples of my work:
