# Hello! :wave:

I'm a Lambda School student studying full stack web development and a contributor to RedwoodJS. I'm currently seeking GitHub sponsors to support my work on Open Source. Your sponsorship will help me spend more time communicating technical topics for developers. What do I do?

### :writing_hand: - Write blog articles  
### :speech_balloon: - Give meetup talks  
### :studio_microphone: - Speak on podcasts
